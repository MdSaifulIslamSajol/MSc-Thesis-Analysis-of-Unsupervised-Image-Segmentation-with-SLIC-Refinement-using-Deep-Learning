# MSc-Thesis-Analysis-of-Unsupervised-Image-Segmentation-with-SLIC-Refinement-using-Deep-Learning
The deep learning concept for image segmentation in a purely unsupervised scenario is analyzed. Convolutional Neural Network is used with SLIC superpixel refinement technique to obtain semantic segmentation. In particular, I develop two extensions of the original algorithm to have more control over the network despite keeping the network solely unsupervised. The research is conducted in three different image datasets i.e. Pascal VOC, STL10, and CIFAR10.  
Farmeworks, tools used: Python, Pytorch, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Scikit-image, Git, Latex.  
## File Description
There are two main files for the proposed two approaches. Both main files can be run seperately.  
(i) The file [main10.2(with_classifier_approach)(for_cifar_stl_pascal)](https://github.com/MdSaifulIslamSajol/MSc-Thesis-Analysis-of-Unsupervised-Image-Segmentation-with-SLIC-Refinement-using-Deep-Learning/blob/f6a351249e8655262bfca355c318c72c9bb328cf/main10.2(with_classifier_approach)(for_cifar_stl_pascal).py) is the code for the proposed first approach for segmentation.  
(ii) The file [main8.4(with_autoencoder_approach)(for_cifar_stl_pascal)](https://github.com/MdSaifulIslamSajol/MSc-Thesis-Analysis-of-Unsupervised-Image-Segmentation-with-SLIC-Refinement-using-Deep-Learning/blob/bdcbca486a6eeebbd5c1db4a01c870c9f421b25b/main8.4(with_autoencoder_approach)(for_cifar_stl_pascal).py) is the code for the proposed second approach for segmentation.  
(iii) The file [Classes](https://github.com/MdSaifulIslamSajol/MSc-Thesis-Analysis-of-Unsupervised-Image-Segmentation-with-SLIC-Refinement-using-Deep-Learning/blob/bdcbca486a6eeebbd5c1db4a01c870c9f421b25b/Classes.py) includes all the classes used for two different approaches for three different data sets.  
(iv) [HelperFunctions.py](https://github.com/MdSaifulIslamSajol/MSc-Thesis-Analysis-of-Unsupervised-Image-Segmentation-with-SLIC-Refinement-using-Deep-Learning/blob/bdcbca486a6eeebbd5c1db4a01c870c9f421b25b/MyHelpers.py) and [MyHelpers.py](https://github.com/MdSaifulIslamSajol/MSc-Thesis-Analysis-of-Unsupervised-Image-Segmentation-with-SLIC-Refinement-using-Deep-Learning/blob/bdcbca486a6eeebbd5c1db4a01c870c9f421b25b/MyHelpers.py) are other helper functions used to configure/show/plot results .
